NorthWind Traders

This is a Milestone 3 student Project I developed as part of my training on the Code Institute Full Stack programming course, at Kerry ETB, Tralee, Ireland

Northwind Traders is a fictions company invented by Microsoft for the purpose of demonstrating their database products, using the Northwind database. Originally Northwind database came out in 1997 with Microsoft Access in order to teach programmers how to use that application.

This website project is based on the way NorthWind Traders database works in Microsoft Access. But all of the functionality is not implemented. At present this website only allows you do do the following: you can view the list of customer orders; you and view the details of each order in a popup modal and you can edit an individual order.

This website uses a MySQL database. It was ported over from the Access .mdb file format.

There are 8 tables in the database:

    categories
    customers
    employees
    order_details
    orders
    products
    shippers
    suppliers

The relationships between the tables is show in this diagram:
